# Predictive-Modeling-of-Cryptocurrency-Prices-
This project aims to analyze and predict Bitcoin prices using various time series and machine learning techniques. We implemented and evaluated models including ARIMA, LSTM, and Random Forest to identify the most effective method for forecasting Bitcoin prices.

# Project Structure
# 1. Data Preparation:
  Load and preprocess Bitcoin price data.
  Calculate daily returns and handle missing values.
  Split the data into training and testing sets.
# 2. Model Implementation:
  ARIMA Model: Time series analysis and forecasting.
  LSTM Model: Recurrent neural network for sequential data.
  Random Forest Model: Ensemble learning method for regression.
# 3. Model Evaluation:
  Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics.
  Compare the performance of different models.
# 4. Feature Importance and Model Interpretation:
  Analyze feature importance for the Random Forest model.
  Use SHAP values to interpret the model's predictions.
